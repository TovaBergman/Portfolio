                        <p>Let's be somewhat redundant and start with this: I'm Tova! As the headline above suggests, I
                            speak both English and Swedish, which is in big part due to the fact that I am from Sweden
                            and live in London. I also speak a very tiny amount of Spanish from my time living in
                            Dominican Republic, but please don't test me on that - I'll only embarrass myself.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As might be evident from the look of this portfolio, designed using my original drawings,
                            I'm quite an artistic person. So it
                            won't be
                            shocking to learn that I have two arts degrees; a Creative Writing BA and a Screenwriting
                            MA. Before coming to the UK for university, however, my academic pursuits looked a bit
                            different. I studied on a Science and Technology programme in my teens, with a Digital
                            Design focus, then went on to study pick-and-mix modules covering subjects including Produce
                            and
                            Nutrition, Folk Culture, Ancient Egyptian and Nordic Religion, and Astrophysics.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After graduating from London Film School, I spent a brief stint working in TV production,
                            researching and coordinating for the documentary series Deadly Disasters which aired on BBC
                            World. Once COVID-19 shut down most of the industry, I instead took a job at TikTok in the
                            spring of 2020, where I would spend 4 years. During my time there, I moved from my first
                            role in Trust & Safety, to the music team working on the newly launched distribution project
                            SoundOn, and then into e-commerce where I started as a trainer and then moved up into
                            programme manager.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Since leaving TikTok, I have taken some time to focus on my health, as I was recovering from
                            surgery. I also took the opportunity to pick up my technology interest again by completing a
                            12-week software development bootcamp, where I have learned several languages and had the
                            chance to build a few projects which I am excited to share.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Now, I feel ready and prepared to step into a new role, and would be interested in junior
                            full-stack developer roles. Considering my background, I would also be a good fit for
                            project management positions, where my coding knowledge would aid in communication and
                            understanding with the team. I'm particularly interested in companies which centre
                            sustainability, femtech, and overall anything which helps to improve our beautiful world.
